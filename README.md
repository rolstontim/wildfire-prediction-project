# wildfire-prediction-project
A group project for seng474 to train a model to be able to predict the likelihood of wildfires occurring in a certain area.

When given specific features, the model will classify whether or not a fire will occur.
Using Linear Regression with a threshold of 0.4, we trained the model to classify a fire.

We used a threshold of 0.4 because even though a fire may not start, the area is still highly prone to a fire and thus, it needs to be closely monitored.
